          <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>

Any unauthorized use of the delivered Products and/or content of this Website may subject you to civil or criminal penalties.</p>
          <h5>No Plagiarism</h5>
          <p>We do not condone, encourage, or knowingly take part in plagiarism or any other acts of fraud or dishonesty. We strongly adhere to and abide by all copyright laws, and will not knowingly allow any Customer to commit plagiarism or violate copyright laws.<br/><br/>Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates and/or partners shall be liable for any unethical, inappropriate, illegal, or otherwise wrongful use of the Products and/or other written material received from our Website.

          <h5>Our policy for using images</h5>
          <p>We do not own the copyright of images unless specifically designed by our in-house illustrators - hence we do not use copyright images by ourselves. We will simply provide you links of recommended images so you can copy and place by yourself. You may use royalty free images without any worry, however for copyright images you may require to pay the owner(s).</p>
          <h5>Refunds</h5>
          <p>Kindly go through our refund policy to fully understand our clauses regarding the refund procedure.  <br/><br/>Please be notified that We do not entertain refund requests if you change your mind. Once an order is delivered you are no longer eligible to ask for 100% refund. Once an Order has been started, the hours put into the project cannot be recuperated and thus we will not provide a refund. The Products and Services offered are non-refundable and come with no warranties, expressed or implied. However, you may ask for up to 3 revisions free of charge. In case you are not 100% satisfied with the quality of product/ services, you may ask for 50% refund against the paid fee amount. <br/><br/> We will process the refund of 50% fee amount subject to verification of the quality concerns you would claim. In case you have a special complaint scenario and demand full fee amount refund then your case shall be forwarded to evaluation-committee and they will take an impartial decision based upon facts and evidences.<br/><br/> Please be notified that you are NOT eligible for 100% refund once an order is completed and delivered from the end of Book Writing Founders. You may request for 3 revisions in total if the provided service does not meet your expectations. You may file a partial refund request if ONLY we have your feedback in written communication followed by disapproved revisions from your end. If you fail to produce any such communication trail, Book Writing Founders won't entertain any refund claims.</p>
          <h5>Limitations on Revisions</h5>
          <p>Editing Orders: We will revise edited content to ensure that no objective or technical errors remain. If no objective or technical errors remain in the content, any further revisions to that content are provided at the sole discretion of the Company.<br/><br/>bookwriting Orders: We will revise small segments of written material until that segment is approved by the Client. Once the Client approves of the content that we develop, revisions to that content will be billed at an appropriate editing rate. </p>
          <h5>Limitation Of Liability</h5>
          <p>You agree to release and hold the Company and its employees, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising, promotion and fulfillment agencies, any third-party providers, or sources of information or data and legal advisers (the “Company’s Affiliates”) harmless from any and all losses, damages, rights, claims, and actions of any kind arising from or related to the Products, including but not limited to: (a) telephone, electronic, hardware or software, network, Internet, email, or computer malfunctions, failures or difficulties of any kind; (b) failed, incomplete, garbled or delayed computer transmissions; (c) any condition caused by events beyond the control of the Company that may cause the Product to be delayed, disrupted, or corrupted; (d) any injuries, losses or damages of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of utilizing our services; or (e) any printing or typographical errors in any materials associated with our services.
