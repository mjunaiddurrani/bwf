                            <h2>Climate Justice â Mary Robinson</h2>
                            <p>The antidote for your climate change paralysis. âSierra Magazine</p>
                            <p>An urgent call to arms by one of the most important voices in the international fight against climate change, sharing inspiring stories and offering vital lessons for the path forward.</p>

                            <p>Holding her first grandchild in her arms in 2003, Mary Robinson was struck by the uncertainty of the world he had been born into. Before his fiftieth birthday, he would share the planet with more than nine billion people--people
                                battling for food, water, and shelter in an increasingly volatile climate. The faceless, shadowy menace of climate change had become, in an instant, deeply personal.</p>

                            <p>Mary Robinsonâs mission would lead her all over the world, from Malawi to Mongolia, and to a heartening revelation: that an irrepressible driving force in the battle for climate justice could be found at the grassroots level,
                                mainly among women, many of them mothers and grandmothers like herself. From Sharon Hanshaw, the Mississippi matriarch whose campaign began in her East Biloxi hair salon and culminated in her speaking at the United Nations,
                                to Constance Okollet, a small farmer who transformed the fortunes of her ailing community in rural Uganda, Robinson met with ordinary people whose resilience and ingenuity had already unlocked extraordinary change.</p>

                            <h2>The Everyday Leader: How to Motivate, Empower and Influence Those Around You</h2>
                            <p>Every day, every one of us is a leader in some way - we just don't necessarily know it. Leadership is about inspiring change and movement, whether on an individual level - a person's attitude, behavior, emotions or habits -
                                or an organizational level - culture, goals, vision or strategy. </p>

                            <p>By changing the way you approach the concept of leadership, The Everyday Leader will help you recognize and embrace your natural leadership qualities, so that you can be more motivated and empowered in the workplace and at
                                home. The Everyday Leader tackles the main challenges that leaders face at some point in their career: leading teams; attaining buy-in from stakeholders; leading through artificial intelligence; whistleblowing; and leading
                                from a distance. </p>

                            <p>But the book also addresses the leadership issues that occur in day-to-day life: listening and empathizing; making change attractive and accessible; influencing and persuading; and making the right decision through information
                                overload. Providing advice and tools for those looking to polish their existing leadership skills or anyone who wants to take the next step in their career, The Everyday Leader also recognizes that leadership doesn't stop
                                once you clock off - these are lessons you can and should take home with you.</p>

                            <p>A love like theirs was destined to either burn bright or go up in flames.</p>
                            <p>California college student Sophie Kavanaugh's first love was the charismatic boy everyone gravitated toward. But he was also the boy with rockstar ambitions and she reluctantly accepted that they would always be worlds apart.
                                When she calls into the radio station he's on, though, everything changes.</p>


                            <p>Gorgeous, magnetic, and with a tendency to overshare his wounded, romantic core, Gavin McManus is living it up as a young rockstar singer. Until Sophie's phone call turns his life upside down.</p>

                            <p>Their public reunion makes them the paparazzi couple everyone obsesses over. But beneath their "perfect" couple surface, their connection is something more complicated.</p>
                            <p>He funnels the angst of his unhealed childhood scars into his love for her. And she craves the way he makes her feel like only she can fix him. It's a desperate kind of love, but it's what works for them.</p>
                            <p>Until it doesn't.</p>
                            <p>When the tabloids get a hold of Gavin's family secret, the backlash is more than he can handle, and he pushes everyone away, including Sophie. At the same time, the band's irresistible guitarist is all too eager to step in
                                and be the support Sophie needs.</p>
                            <p>With their world falling down around them, Gavin and Sophie must try to reignite their white-hot connection before it consumes them.</p>
                            <p>This is not a stand-alone book, but the series is complete with three more books:</p>

                            <p>Hard-charging and irrepressible, eighteen-year-old Amelia Linehan could see a roller derby opponent a mile awayâand thatâs while crouched down, bent over skates, and zooming around a track at the speed of light.</p>

                            <p>What she couldnât see coming, however, was the flare-up of the rare liver disorder she was born with. But now itâs the only thing sheâand everyone around herâcan think about. </p>

                            <p>With no guarantee of a viable organ transplant, everything Ameliaâs been sure ofâlike college plans or the possibility of one day falling in loveâhas become a huge question mark, threatening to drag her down into a sea of what-ifs
                                sheâs desperate to avoid.</p>

                            <p>Then a friend from the past shows up. With Will, itâs easy to forget about whatâs lurking between the lightness of their time together. She feels alive when all signs point elsewhere.

                            <p>âThe Survivors is an astonishingly beautiful and profoundly moving book. Frankelâs haunting search to unravel the mysteries of his family is so compelling that it reads like a fine novel.ââ Doris Kearns Goodwin

                            <p>Adam Frankelâs maternal grandparents survived the Holocaust and built new lives, with new names, in Connecticut. Though they tried to leave the horrors of their past behind, the pain they suffered crossed generational linesâa
                                fact most apparent in the mental health of Adamâs mother. When Adam sat down with her to examine their family history in detail, he learned another shocking secret, this time one that unraveled Adamâs entire understanding
                                of who he is.</p>


                            <p>In the midst of piecing together a story of inherited familial trauma, Adam discovered he was only half of who he thought he was, knowledge that raised essential questions of identity. Who was he, if not his fatherâs son? If
                                not part of a rich heritage of writers and public servants? Does it matter? What defines a familyâs bonds? What will he pass on to his own children? To rewrite his story in truth and to build a life for his own young family,
                                Adam had to navigate his pain to find answers and a way forward.</p>

                            <p>Throughout this journey into the past, his familyâs psyche, and his own understanding of identity, Adam comes to realize that while the nature of our familiesâ traumas may vary, each of us is faced with the same choice. We
                                can turn away from what weâve inheritedâor, we can confront it, in the hopes of moving on and stopping that trauma from inflicting pain on future generations. The stories Adam shares with us in The Survivors are about the
                                ways the past can haunt our future, the resilience that can be found on the other side of trauma, and the good that can come from things that are unspeakably bad.</p>

                            <h2>Corporate recruiter reveals</h2>

                            <p>Corporate Recruiter Reveals Who Gets Hired and Why demystifies and personalizes the human resource office by spelling out the steps required for getting a job and advancing within your company.</p>

                            <p>The book is written from a highly successful, current hands-on corporate recruiter perspective. Many books on the market today are written by those that study staffing, consult on a part-time basis, or are far removed from
                                the day-to-day life of a recruiter that is sourcing, screening and extending offers to job seekers. Author, Kelly Smith, has been in the trenches interacting with the hiring authorities to find out what they are requiring
                                from a quality candidate.</p>

                            <p>Corporate Recruiter Reveals Who Gets Hired and Why will assist the unemployed as well as the currently employed looking to advance their career within their current company or looking to make a move elsewhere. On average, every
                                2 to 5 years an employee is looking for their new employer and the length of time shortens when it comes to how long an employee will stay in the same position of employment.</p>
                            <p>Corporate Recruiter Reveals Who Gets Hired and Why reveals actual emails, cover letters, resumes and phone screens for the reader to view and refer to. The reader can see what other job seekers have done correctly to win their
                                job offer or what mistakes they've made during the interview with their resume or cover letter.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, another advantage this book provides is sample templates for the full-life-cycle recruitment process, including the rarely mentioned, offer letter process.</p>
                            <p>In her book, Kelly, doesn't tell the reader she shows the reader what has or has not worked in real life job seeking situations.</p>
                            <p>Happy Job Hunting!</p>

                            <h2>Playing at love</h2>
                            <p>Conor Quinn is the gorgeous guitarist for the popular, yet recently troubled rock band Rogue. And he's made a mistake. A stomach-churning, heart-aching, nothing-will-ever-be-right-again mistake. So, what do you do after your
                                mistake - your betrayal - has been revealed? One that's threatened both a lifelong friendship and a music partnership? If you're book-smart but love-dumb Conor, you woo back your ex in an effort to prove you've moved on.
                                But when Conor's old schoolmate unexpectedly returns to his world, he gravitates with increasing frequency toward their renewed friendship. Harmless flirting soon turns into real temptation and suddenly Conor's questioning
                                whether his impetuous reunion with his ex means he's missed his chance with the right woman. Can Conor make the right decisions and finally stop playing at love?</p>
